# E-commerce Project Using different ML Regression models, building a neural network for regression.
  - This Project includes different models like, catboost, Ensemble models and keras model.
  - To determine the optimal model(i.e. the one that returned the least Error['mae','mse']), the data was cleaned and sorted.
  - The data was splited for training and model processing.
  - After using Different models, the linear Regression model from sklearn module produced the least error after prediction as it has the closest mean absolute error to zero.
